# StockPredictor 
Machine Learning Repo, study performed on reliability of a stock prediction algorithm on full price action history.

## Stock Predictions are unreliable on a simple machine, not recommended to trade based on it alone.

### Code should be run in a NodeJs server, for each prediction you should restart the server, the algorithm is trained on the historical data of the specific asset without reset, causing it to fail on predictions of an alternative asset, code could be improved by retraining on different data for different predictions, but a server restart does the job.

#### Available in Python and Javascript.
